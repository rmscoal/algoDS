"""
Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece,
always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate
benefit. Greedy algorithms are used for optimization problems. 

An optimization problem can be solved using Greedy if the problem has the
following property: 

At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment, and we get
the optimal solution to the complete problem.
